Thank you for volunteering to be the Timer at the Speakers' Guild. Learning to speak to an allotted time is an important skill; it signals that you respect the value of your audience's time. In practical terms, it also benefits the group as we attempt to make the most of the hour we spend together and helps to focus decisions on the structure of a speech. It's the meeting Chair's job to keep the meeting moving along according to schedule, but in order to practice the skill of speaking to time, the Timer will provide timing lights to speakers and record the time they speak for in their allocated roles. The Timer also delivers a brief Timing Report to feedback at the end of the meeting. Time allocations Each role is allotted a target time range. It is prominent on the meeting agenda, along with the indications of the timing lights. Please ask the chair for a copy in advance if you aren't familiar with the format. For most roles, the speaker will get a GREEN light when they have met their minimum target speaking time and a RED light when they reach their maximum allocated time. Halfway between, they receive a YELLOW light . If they go significantly over their time, they receive a BUZZ. Each of these stages is documented for each role on the agenda. Operating the timing lights While in hybrid hangout/room mode, it's recommended that Timer use the Toastmasters International mobile app, available for free on both platforms' stores. Install the app and launch it, selecting \"Use as a guest\". Then set \"Timer\". Under the settings cog, deselect \"Display time while running\". The clock can be started or stopped with a tap. Orienting your phone in the landscape will display the timing lights full-screen as they come due with a grey screen before the minimum time is achieved; a spinner indicates the clock is running, and it can be viewed in portrait mode to monitor it before green needs to be displayed. Familiarise yourself with the use of the app before the session. It's not complicated, but it needs to get used to. Most roles are preconfigured in the app, but the details vary and are summarised by the function below. Timing each role Follow the instructions below for each role, noting the time each speaker takes. A pen and paper are genuinely useful for this; your phone's in use for timing and typing is distracting. 30-SECOND WARMUP : use your phone's stopwatch for this or any preset on the app. It's not worth displaying lights. Just make an audible BUZZ sound after 45 seconds unless the speaker is visiting for the first time (we're lenient for them here; it's their first impression of us). TABLE TOPICS : The chair will indicate whether the number of people in the room justifies 2-minute table topics or whether we will speak for one minute each. 2-minute Table Topics: use the Table Topics preset in the app; this will display GREEN at 1:00, YELLOW at 1:30 and RED at 2:00 1-minute Table Topics: use the Custom preset in the app and enter 0:45 for the minimum time (GREEN) and 1:00 for the maximum time (RED). Yellow will fall between them. In either case, buzz the speaker if they go over red by more than 30 seconds. TABLE TOPICS EVALUATORS : These are delivered by two evaluators in alternating fashion; you time their entire slot as one. Select speech type \"Intro speech (4:00 - 6:00)\" to configure the app for this role and buzz them at 6:30. PREPARED SPEECHES : of all speech types, this is the most important to time well; your speakers have practised speaking within this time range, and they should be expecting the GREEN and YELLOW lights to guide their pace. It's a good idea to be monitoring the clock in portrait mode, so you are ready to display the light (in landscape) from exactly 5 minutes till the end of their speech. Select Prepared Speech as the app preset for this and beep them at 7:30 and every 30 seconds after that should they fail to wrap up. You don't need to buzz if it's obvious they're in their concluding sentences. SPEECH EVALUATORS : use the Evaluation preset (2:00 - 3:00) The timing report The Timer has one minute to give feedback on how we tracked for time. Some agenda sections can be summarised; not every speech needs itemising. Again these are outlined by role below. General comments Note whether the meeting is currently running on time (is the wall clock close to the scheduled time of your report?) and any reasons the meeting ran over (late start? Too many table topics?) It's the chair's role to keep things moving, but throughout the session, keep an eye on the time vs the agenda to help. These comments should be a few sentences. 30-SECOND WARMUP : Summarise roughly how well we did vs the target, call out the longest and shortest but be kind to first-timers. TABLE TOPICS : Again, this can be summarised in general terms with excessively short or long contributions noted. TABLE TOPICS EVALUATORS : Report on their total time, but with consideration for the idea that each TT evaluation should be about 30 seconds. If there were only five TTs, but it took 6 minutes to evaluate them, that's worth noting even though they were in their window. PREPARED SPEECHES : these should be noted individually as they are precious to speakers. Comment on their time, the minimum (5 minutes) and maximum (7 minutes). Encourage speakers who spoke for less than 6 minutes to consider using a little more time. It should be clearly fed back as constructive criticism if a speech went under the minimum or over the maximum. SPEECH EVALUATORS : Note these individually relative to the target times. If you've had to buzz anyone at any stage, then it's good to mention that in your report too. Although these notes are pretty long, the timing report should be concise and helpful. It's an essential part of our evaluation method as we strive to be respectful of each other's time.","title":"Lorem Ipsum Two"},{"location":"lorem-ipsum-two/#tips-for-being-a-great-timer","text":"Thank you for volunteering to be the Timer at the Speakers' Guild.
